We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God. But God will not suffer your faith to go waste, for God is to men full of mercy and grace.\n(2:157) — On such men are the blessings of God and His mercy, for they are indeed on the right path.\n(2:286) — God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry. Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers.\n(3:132) — Obey God and the Prophet, that you may be treated with mercy.\n(3:157) — If you are killed in the cause of God or you die, the forgiveness and mercy of God are better than all that you amass.\n(3:159) — It was through God's mercy that you dealt with them gently; for had you been stern and hard of heart they would surely have broken away from you. So pardon them and pray that forgiveness be theirs, and seek their counsel in all affairs, And when you have come to a decision place your trust in God alone, for He loves those who place their trust in Him.\n(3:171) — They rejoice at the kindness and mercy of God; and God does not suffer the wages of the faithful to go waste.\n(4:83) — And when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around. Had they gone to the Prophet or those in authority among them, then those who check and scrutinize would have known it, And but for the favour of God and His mercy you would certainly have followed Satan, except a few.\n(4:99) — May well hope for the mercy of God; and God is full of mercy and grace."
